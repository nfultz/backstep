backstep 0.3:

This release makes all the icon frames the same size.  This doesn't scale the 
actual icon pixmaps.  I played around with doing it that way and decided to just
adjust the surrounding frames.  Some icons, especially those with thin lines, 
look really bad or even almost disappear when scaled.  So I think just forcing
the frames to a common size is the best thing to do for now.  But if anyone
disagrees, please let me know.  In any case, scaling the icons may be an option
in the future.  

Also, a bug effecting window managers (like Metacity) that show an animation 
when a window is minimized was fixed.  The _NET_WM_ICON_GEOMETRY was only 
getting set after the first minimization, so the first time the icon was shown
the animation would go to the wrong place.  This should work properly now.
